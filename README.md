# mindsafe-comments

This repository serves as the backend for [Giscus](https://giscus.app/) comments
on my personal website, which hosts synchronized public notes from my
[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault.

## About

I use Obsidian to manage both public and private notes. While private notes
remain unpublished, public notes are automatically synchronized to my website,
creating a dynamic platform for sharing knowledge. Visitors can engage with the
content by leaving comments through Giscus, a comment system powered by
[GitHub Discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions).

## How It Works

- Public notes are regularly synchronized to the website.
- This repository enables Giscus to function as the commenting system, linking
  GitHub Discussions to each note.
- Only public notes are available on the website, ensuring private notes remain
  secure.
